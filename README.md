# SMART Bear Tutor
If you have any questions about the app or this repo, don't hesitate to reach out to John Minney at jminneyiii@gmail or Discord Ex0dus#2702

## App Description:
SmartBear is a simple android/IOS application created using Flutter and Firebase, by students of the University of Northern Colorado. The goal of the app is to encourage students from the University of Northern Colorado (UNCO) to use Tutorial Services. The app allows students to ask a simple question to a tutor, and get a response, allowing them to get a taste of what Tutorial Services has to offer and potentially bringing them into the center. The app also allows students to receive information about Tutorial services via FAQs, or links directly to their website which can be hard to navigate.

### Pushing to the Repo
Due to merge conflicts we will have a seperate branch for each team of developers or task. We can then use these branches to push code without causing merge conflicts between the teams/tasks. Below are the instructions to change branches.

Make Sure to Checkout Jacob's Tutorial. It is amazing [Video Link](https://youtu.be/0urqEJmf73s)

To create a branch you can either follow the steps below or ask me (John Minney) and I can get it set up for you.
> * While looking at the Github page for the project look for a dropdown menu that will most likely say "main"
> * Click on this dropdown and make sure you are on the main branch
> * Enter the name of your new branch in the text box
> * Once you enter the name there will be a section that says "Create branch: branch_name from 'main'
> * Click that and it will create the new branch
> * Once you have created the new branch pull on your local machine and you will be able to checkout the new branch

### CML Commands Below (if you want to use a GUI check out the video linked above)
For the following steps replace *branch_name* with your teams working branch.
If you are using git bash (command line) follow these steps to switch branches.
> If you are using a UI follow their documentation or tutorial videos to switch branches
* Find your way to the local version of the project
* Type the command `git branch -a`
* If you don't see your branch listed run `git pull`
* If you can locate your branch use the command `git checkout branch_name`
* You are now working on your team's branch. Push code like you would normally

**Important!!**
The first time you push to the branch use the command `git push -u origin branch_name`

When you are done working on your branch create a Pull Request for the code to be reviewed. This will allow your repo admin to review the code for any merge conflicts before merging it with the main branch.
